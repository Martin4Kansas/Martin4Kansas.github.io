I'm a recent Computer Science and Mathematics graduate from Kansas State University. I relocated to Madison, WI to work in the IT Early Development Program for John Deere Financial. I am passionate about technology, agriculture, human rights and equity for all people. Please reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate on a project that can benefit your community, your country or the world. To see my qualifications, feel free to peruse my [resume](https://martin4kansas.github.io/react-resume).

### A bit more about me

I'm from a small town just outside Kansas City called Spring Hill, KS. In college, I was involved in a lot of organizations, but a few of my favorites were:  
  
- [Acacia](http://acaciaksstate.org/) where I was Risk Management Chairman
- [Student Governing Association](https://ksu.edu/sga)
- [Union Governing Board](https://union.ksu.edu)
- [Scholars Assisting Scholars Tutoring](https://engg.ksu.edu/sas)
  
In Kansas as well as Wisconsin, I have gotten involved with political campaigns at the national, state and local level. I love knocking on doors to try and make my communities a better place for all. I also volunteer for [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/) and have worked with [100 Black Men of Madison](https://www.100blackmenmadison.org/) through John Deere. Outside of volunteering, I am an avid film and television connoisseur and have recently started writing short movie reviews after watchings. I also recently decided to go back to Kansas State (virtually) to work on my Master of Science in Data Analytics degree.
