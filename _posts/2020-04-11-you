The second TV show in my countdown is You. Shortly after Netflix added the first season to their lineup, I binged it and couldn't believe that the show had failed on Lifetime. I was then incredibly relieved to learn that Netflix was taking it on as an original, though I was skeptical that the second season would live up to the first. When Netflix released season two last year, at first I was afraid that my skepticism was warrented, but as the season went on, it lived up to original and, in the minds of many, surpassed the original.   
  
... will add more later...

What a weird, little, intelligent creature. Characters like him are what make Futurama so great.
