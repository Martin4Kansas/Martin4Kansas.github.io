title: Welcome to my blog!

Hello blog reader! Welcome to my blog. I'm not entirely sure what all I will post on this blog, but I do have some ideas. I will definitely post about things I learn at work. I work in software, so there are always new things that I can share. I will also post about the media I consume, be it podcasts, books, movies, TV shows or music. Once the global pandemic that is COVID-19 is over, I will also share all of the cool places that I travel to. Finally, I'll make sure to share some of my thoughts on the current political landscape. I'll focus mostly on national and state (Wisconsin, Kansas and Iowa mostly), but also local and global politics. I hope you'll find something that you enjoy or can learn from.
